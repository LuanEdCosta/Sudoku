# :1234: Sudoku

[Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle that is not very simple to create with programming, but i always wanted to do.

## :page_with_curl: About and Conclusion

In this project i studied more about the Vue framework and started to learn **ESlint**.

I defined some rules to ensure that the code will follow my prefered style and didn't try to use any popular style guide because i wanted to learn more only about the eslint and some basic rules.

At the end of this project i noticed that eslint has a lot of plugins and configurations and the use of a style guide would be a good choice for new projects.
